# Laravel Contact Skeleton Project

## Get Started

Following the steps below to get start:

* Since the skeleton is raw (i.e. we will use many handcrafted code vs. using the `WebDev` libraries), it has not been added to the `IASTATE` composer repository yet. To get started, go to [the BitBucket repo](https://git.its.iastate.edu/projects/WEBDEV-TRAINING/repos/zuo-laravel-training-skeleton/browse), create a fork of the project, and starts from there. 

* Assuming you have finished the `Git` lessons, clone the forked repo to your dev machine, and run `composer install` to install all dependencies. 

* Create a symlink from your repo location to expose project's `public` folder for your locker.

* Go to the locker and verify that the website is up and running, with a blank index page.
